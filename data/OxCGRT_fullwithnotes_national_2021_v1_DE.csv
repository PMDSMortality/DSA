While expansions of testing were announced, they will not be implemented until April meaning coding stays how it is currently.     Previous coding note:   Rapid tests will be made available for the general public.  The national testing strategy will therefore be supplemented by the following measures, which are to be implemented step by step by the beginning of April:   -	In order to ensure safe school operations and safe childcare, the Länder will ensure that staff in schools and childcare facilities as well as all pupils receive the offer of at least one free rapid test per week of attendance as part of their testing concepts. A certificate of the test result shall be issued where possible.   -	For comprehensive protection against infection, it is necessary that companies in Germany offer at least one free rapid test per week to their employees who are present at work, as part of their overall contribution to society. A certificate of the test result shall be issued where possible. The Federal Government will discuss this with the business community later this week.   -	All asymptomatic citizens will be allowed a free rapid test at least once a week, including a certificate of the test result, at a testing centre operated by the respective Land or municipality, at third parties commissioned by the respective Land or municipality or at GPs’ surgeries. The Federal Government will cover the costs from 8 March onwards.

This will enable to communicate transparently the evidence-based rationale of the priority levels given to different groups. This hierarchy organised into six groups is expected to be updated throughout the pandemic, as the situation develops and more evidence and resources (e.g. new vaccines) become available: Group 1 includes people living in care and nursing homes, people aged 80 years and older, staff working in health care settings with particularly high risk of exposure (e.g. A&E, staff caring for COVID-19 patients), staff in health care setting in close contact with groups at particularly high risk (e.g. Haemato-oncology, transplant medicine), care workers in domiciliary and residential long-term care for older people and others working in care and nursing homes in contact with residents. It is estimated that this group amounts to 8.6 million people.[3] Group 2 includes people aged 75 to 79 years, staff in medical care settings with high risk of exposure, people with dementia and mental disabilities living in residential care settings, people working domiciliary and residential care with people with dementia or people with mental disabilities as well as people living with Down-Syndrome. This group includes an estimated 7 million people.[4] Group 3 covers approximately 5.7 million people[5] and includes those aged 70 to 74 years, people who have had an organ transplant; people with pre-existing conditions and who are at high risk, people living in sheltered accommodation/refuges and staff; close contacts of pregnant women; close contacts/family carers of people at high risk; staff at moderate risk of exposure in health care settings and in positions relevant to maintaining hospital infrastructure; parts of the public health authorities. Group 4 (approximately 4.9 million people[6]) consists of those aged 65 to 69 years; people with pre-existing conditions who are at moderate risk and their closest contacts, staff working in health care settings with low risk of exposure, teachers, educators, people in precarious work or living situations. People aged 60 to 64 years, staff in key local and federal government positions, people working in retail; people required to maintain public security with heightened risk of exposure and people working in critical infrastructure fall into Group 5 (about 8.4 million people[7]).
