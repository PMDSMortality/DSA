On 30 June 2020, the Council of the EU adopted the Council Recommendation on the temporary restriction on non-essential travel into the EU and the possible lifting of such restriction (Council document 2020/912). According to this recommendation, member states intend to lift, in a coordinated and gradual way, the temporary restriction of non-essential travel into the EU for residents of certain third countries (that is, those who have their domicile or habitual residence there). The list of these third countries is regularly reviewed and updated as necessary.    Based on this recommendation, Germany lifted the restrictions on travel for residents of eight third countries as of 2 July.    A first update removed two of these countries from the EU list of safe countries based on the Council Recommendation amending Recommendation (EU) 2020/912 of the Council on the temporary restriction on non-essential travel into the EU and the possible lifting of such restriction of 16 July 2020, which Germany implemented on 17 July 2020. Two more countries were classified as risk areas on 7 October 2020, which made it necessary to update the national list of safe countries.

For all persons residing in a third country that is not included in the above list, the current restrictions on travel continue to apply, i.e. these persons may enter Germany only if they serve in an important role or if there is an urgent need for their travel. A person is considered to reside in a country if they have their domicile or habitual residence there. A person is specifically considered to have their domicile in a country if they have spent the past six months there.    The restrictions do not apply to German citizens.

This will enable to communicate transparently the evidence-based rationale of the priority levels given to different groups. This hierarchy organised into six groups is expected to be updated throughout the pandemic, as the situation develops and more evidence and resources (e.g. new vaccines) become available: Group 1 includes people living in care and nursing homes, people aged 80 years and older, staff working in health care settings with particularly high risk of exposure (e.g. A&E, staff caring for COVID-19 patients), staff in health care setting in close contact with groups at particularly high risk (e.g. Haemato-oncology, transplant medicine), care workers in domiciliary and residential long-term care for older people and others working in care and nursing homes in contact with residents. It is estimated that this group amounts to 8.6 million people.[3] Group 2 includes people aged 75 to 79 years, staff in medical care settings with high risk of exposure, people with dementia and mental disabilities living in residential care settings, people working domiciliary and residential care with people with dementia or people with mental disabilities as well as people living with Down-Syndrome. This group includes an estimated 7 million people.[4] Group 3 covers approximately 5.7 million people[5] and includes those aged 70 to 74 years, people who have had an organ transplant; people with pre-existing conditions and who are at high risk, people living in sheltered accommodation/refuges and staff; close contacts of pregnant women; close contacts/family carers of people at high risk; staff at moderate risk of exposure in health care settings and in positions relevant to maintaining hospital infrastructure; parts of the public health authorities. Group 4 (approximately 4.9 million people[6]) consists of those aged 65 to 69 years; people with pre-existing conditions who are at moderate risk and their closest contacts, staff working in health care settings with low risk of exposure, teachers, educators, people in precarious work or living situations. People aged 60 to 64 years, staff in key local and federal government positions, people working in retail; people required to maintain public security with heightened risk of exposure and people working in critical infrastructure fall into Group 5 (about 8.4 million people[7]).

As a result, the Bundestag and Bundesrat passed an amendment to the Infection Protection Act. Employees who work at hospitals, nursing homes and similar institutions must therefore provide proof of being vaccinated against or having recovered from COVID-19.    https://web.archive.org/web/20221208111439/https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/themen/coronavirus/coronavirus-vaccination-faq-1959802    Germany’s top court has approved a mandate for health workers to be vaccinated against COVID-19.    The Federal Constitutional Court announced on Thursday that it had rejected complaints against the measure, which came into effect in mid-March.    The court said that the importance of protecting vulnerable people in hospitals and care homes outweighs any infringement of health workers’ rights.    Judges had previously refused to issue an injunction blocking the rules from coming into effect.    Health Minister Karl Lauterbach welcomed Thursday’s ruling, saying that “the state is obliged to protect vulnerable groups.”    https://web.archive.org/web/20221208174126/https://www.euronews.com/2022/05/19/germany-s-top-court-approves-vaccine-mandate-for-health-workers    On 27 April 2022, the German Constitutional Court rejected challenges to the vaccine mandate for healthcare workers (case reference: 1 BvR 2649/21).    The case concerned the obligation for professionals working in the healthcare system to provide a vaccine or recovery certificate to attend work. The challenged rule applied not only to medical or nurse employees, but also to the administrative, cleaning or kitchen staff, if they are employed by a healthcare facility. From 15 March 2022, the absence of a vaccine or recovery certificate prevents employees from entering the employers's premises and to exercise their professional activity.    The claimants had alleged an infringement to the bodily integrity and to the right to exercise a profession. However, the court rejected the claim, holding that the interference with the right of bodily integrity is justified because the legislators pursued a legitimate scope to protect vulnerable groups from COVID-19 infection.

Due to the situation in the fourth wave, the deplorably high numbers of new cases and deaths and the extremely serious and sometimes even dramatic situation in the healthcare system, the Länder requested the Federal Government to impose a so-called facility-based vaccine mandate as soon as possible: all employees who have contact with vulnerable persons in hospitals and integration assistance facilities as well as in nursing homes, care homes and mobile care services will be required to be vaccinated against the coronavirus. As a result, the Bundestag and Bundesrat passed an amendment to the Infection Protection Act. Employees who work at hospitals, nursing homes and similar institutions must therefore provide proof of being vaccinated against or having recovered from COVID-19.    https://web.archive.org/web/20221208111439/https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/themen/coronavirus/coronavirus-vaccination-faq-1959802    Germany’s top court has approved a mandate for health workers to be vaccinated against COVID-19.    The Federal Constitutional Court announced on Thursday that it had rejected complaints against the measure, which came into effect in mid-March.    The court said that the importance of protecting vulnerable people in hospitals and care homes outweighs any infringement of health workers’ rights.    Judges had previously refused to issue an injunction blocking the rules from coming into effect.    Health Minister Karl Lauterbach welcomed Thursday’s ruling, saying that “the state is obliged to protect vulnerable groups.”    https://web.archive.org/web/20221208174126/https://www.euronews.com/2022/05/19/germany-s-top-court-approves-vaccine-mandate-for-health-workers    On 27 April 2022, the German Constitutional Court rejected challenges to the vaccine mandate for healthcare workers (case reference: 1 BvR 2649/21).    The case concerned the obligation for professionals working in the healthcare system to provide a vaccine or recovery certificate to attend work. The challenged rule applied not only to medical or nurse employees, but also to the administrative, cleaning or kitchen staff, if they are employed by a healthcare facility. From 15 March 2022, the absence of a vaccine or recovery certificate prevents employees from entering the employers's premises and to exercise their professional activity.    The claimants had alleged an infringement to the bodily integrity and to the right to exercise a profession. However, the court rejected the claim, holding that the interference with the right of bodily integrity is justified because the legislators pursued a legitimate scope to protect vulnerable groups from COVID-19 infection.    About the encroachment of the right to exercise a profession, the court distinguished between medical and nursing staff from other kind of employees: the former are obliged to provide a proof of vaccination as a prerequisite, in order to exercise their professional activity. The latter are required to provide the vaccination or recovered certificate because they come into contact with medical and nursing staff and indirectly with vulnerable groups.

As a result, the Bundestag and Bundesrat passed an amendment to the Infection Protection Act. Employees who work at hospitals, nursing homes and similar institutions must therefore provide proof of being vaccinated against or having recovered from COVID-19.    https://web.archive.org/web/20221208111439/https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/themen/coronavirus/coronavirus-vaccination-faq-1959802    Germany’s top court has approved a mandate for health workers to be vaccinated against COVID-19.    The Federal Constitutional Court announced on Thursday that it had rejected complaints against the measure, which came into effect in mid-March.    The court said that the importance of protecting vulnerable people in hospitals and care homes outweighs any infringement of health workers’ rights.    Judges had previously refused to issue an injunction blocking the rules from coming into effect.    Health Minister Karl Lauterbach welcomed Thursday’s ruling, saying that “the state is obliged to protect vulnerable groups.”    https://web.archive.org/web/20221208174126/https://www.euronews.com/2022/05/19/germany-s-top-court-approves-vaccine-mandate-for-health-workers    On 27 April 2022, the German Constitutional Court rejected challenges to the vaccine mandate for healthcare workers (case reference: 1 BvR 2649/21).    The case concerned the obligation for professionals working in the healthcare system to provide a vaccine or recovery certificate to attend work. The challenged rule applied not only to medical or nurse employees, but also to the administrative, cleaning or kitchen staff, if they are employed by a healthcare facility. From 15 March 2022, the absence of a vaccine or recovery certificate prevents employees from entering the employers's premises and to exercise their professional activity.    The claimants had alleged an infringement to the bodily integrity and to the right to exercise a profession. However, the court rejected the claim, holding that the interference with the right of bodily integrity is justified because the legislators pursued a legitimate scope to protect vulnerable groups from COVID-19 infection.    About the encroachment of the right to exercise a profession, the court distinguished between medical and nursing staff from other kind of employees: the former are obliged to provide a proof of vaccination as a prerequisite, in order to exercise their professional activity. The latter are required to provide the vaccination or recovered certificate because they come into contact with medical and nursing staff and indirectly with vulnerable groups.    The court also mentioned the sentence of the challenged provision authorising the ban to enter the employers' premises or from working there, if the healthcare staff does not comply with the vaccine mandate. This ban gives rise to a separate interference with occupational freedom. However, the court again relied on the argument that this interference is justified to protect vulnerable groups.    https://web.archive.org/web/20221201192147/https://www.covid19litigation.org/news/2022/05/germany-healthcare-workers-vaccine-mandates-justified-constitutional-court-holds""]",3.0,1.0,,,,,3.0,1.0,"['https://archive.ph/xXvKC', 'https://archive.ph/4rMTA']",[],2.0,"['https://archive.ph/xXvKC', 'https://archive.ph/4rMTA']",3.0,[],5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,[],1.0,[],25912063.42857143,137966.57142857142,V,75.94428571428571,16.67,13.89,15.28,14.56,50.0,48.44,49.21999999999999,48.82,42.86,41.07,41.96999999999999,41.5,100.0
